This Movie Recommender System is a content-based recommendation engine built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It suggests movies similar to a given title by analyzing the textual content such as movie overviews, genres, and other metadata.

The system uses a Bag of Words (BoW) model to convert movie descriptions into numerical feature vectors. These vectors represent the presence of important words in each movieâ€™s metadata. To measure the similarity between movies, Cosine Similarity is applied, which helps identify how closely related two movies are based on their textual content.

Before vectorization, the data undergoes essential NLP preprocessing steps including lowercasing, removing punctuation, eliminating stopwords, tokenization, and stemming or lemmatization. This ensures that the model focuses on meaningful words and patterns for better recommendations.

The project is implemented using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. It provides an efficient and scalable way to recommend movies, even for users with no prior interaction history, making it ideal for cold-start scenarios
